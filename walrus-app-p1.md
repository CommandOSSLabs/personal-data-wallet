Walrus

Walrus

Welcome to the developer documentation for Walrus, a decentralized storage and data
availability protocol designed speci?cally for large binary ?les, or "blobs". Walrus focuses on
providing a robust but a?ordable solution for storing unstructured content on decentralized
storage nodes while ensuring high availability and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine
faults.

Fun fact

If you are viewing this site at https://docs.wal.app, you are fetching this from Walrus behind
the scenes. See the Walrus Sites chapter for further details on how this works.

Features

Storage and retrieval: Walrus supports storage operations to write and read blobs. It
also allows anyone to prove that a blob has been stored and is available for retrieval at a

later time.

Cost e?ciency: By utilizing advanced erasure coding, Walrus maintains storage costs at
approximately ?ve times the size of the stored blobs, and encoded parts of each blob are
stored on each storage node. This is signi?cantly more cost-e?ective than traditional full-
replication methods and much more robust against failures than protocols that only store
each blob on a subset of storage nodes.

Integration with the Sui blockchain: Walrus leverages Sui for coordination, attesting
availability, and payments. Storage space is represented as a resource on Sui, which can
be owned, split, merged, and transferred. Stored blobs are also represented by objects on
Sui, which means that smart contracts can check whether a blob is available and for how
long, extend its lifetime or optionally delete it.

Epochs, tokenomics, and delegated proof of stake: Walrus is operated by a committee
of storage nodes that evolve between epochs. A native token, WAL (and its subdivision
FROST, where 1 WAL is equal to 1 billion FROST), is used to delegate stake to storage
nodes, and those with high stake become part of the epoch committee. The WAL token is
also used for payments for storage. At the end of each epoch, rewards for selecting
storage nodes, storing and serving blobs are distributed to storage nodes and whose that
stake with them. All these processes are mediated by smart contracts on the Sui platform.

Walrus

Flexible access: Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line interface (CLI),
software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP technologies. Walrus is designed to
work well with traditional caches and content distribution networks (CDNs), while
ensuring all operations can also be run using local tools to maximize decentralization.

Public access

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all. Therefore you must not
use Walrus to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional
measures to protect con?dentiality. Refer to Data Security for such use cases.

Architecture and operations

Walrus's architecture ensures that content remains accessible and retrievable even when many
storage nodes are unavailable or malicious. Under the hood it uses modern error correction
techniques based on fast linear fountain codes, augmented to ensure resilience against
Byzantine faults, and a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains
simple, and storage node management and blob certi?cation leverages Sui smart contracts.

Organization

Announcing Walrus: A Decentralized Storage
and Data Availability Protocol

Published on: 2024-06-18

Warning

This blog post is shown in its original form and may contain information that is no longer
accurate. Some broken links may have been updated or removed.

Walrus is an innovative decentralized storage network for blockchain apps and autonomous

agents. The Walrus storage system is being released today as a developer preview for Sui
builders in order to gather feedback. We expect a broad rollout to other web3 communities
very soon!

Leveraging innovations in erasure coding, Walrus enables fast and robust encoding of

unstructured data blobs into smaller slivers distributed and stored over a network of storage
nodes. A subset of slivers can be used to rapidly reconstruct the original blob, even when up to
two-thirds of the slivers are missing. This is possible while keeping the replication factor down
to a minimal 4x-5x, similar to existing cloud-based services, but with the additional bene?ts of
decentralization and resilience to more widespread faults.

The Replication Challenge

Sui is the most advanced blockchain system in relation to storage on validators, with

innovations such as a storage fund that future-proofs the cost of storing data on-chain.
Nevertheless, Sui still requires complete data replication among all validators, resulting in a
replication factor of 100x or more in today√Üs Sui Mainnet. While this is necessary for replicated
computing and smart contracts acting on the state of the blockchain, it is ine?cient for simply
storing unstructured data blobs, such as music, video, blockchain history, etc.

Introducing Walrus: E?cient and Robust Decentralized
Storage

To tackle the challenge of high replication costs, Mysten Labs has developed Walrus, a
decentralized storage network o?ering exceptional data availability and robustness with a
minimal replication factor of 4x-5x. Walrus provides two key bene?ts:

1. Cost-E?ective Blob Storage: Walrus allows for the uploading of gigabytes of data at a
time with minimal cost, making it an ideal solution for storing large volumes of data.
Walrus can do this because the data blob is transmitted only once over the network, and
storage nodes only spend a fraction of resources compared to the blob size. As a result,
the more storage nodes the system has, the fewer resources each storage node uses per

blob.

2. High Availability and Robustness: Data stored on Walrus enjoys enhanced reliability

and availability under fault conditions. Data recovery is still possible even if two-thirds of
the storage nodes crash or come under adversarial control. Further, availability may be
certi?ed e?ciently without downloading the full blob.

Decentralized storage can take multiple forms in modern ecosystems. For instance, it o?ers
better guarantees for digital assets traded as NFTs. Unlike current designs that store data o?-
chain, decentralized storage ensures users own the actual resource, not just metadata,
mitigating risks of data being taken down or misrepresented.

Additionally, decentralized storage is not only useful for storing data such as pictures or ?les
with high availability; it can also double as a low-cost data availability layer for rollups. Here,
sequencers can upload transactions on Walrus, and the rollup executor only needs to
temporarily reconstruct them for execution.

We also believe Walrus will accompany existing disaster recovery strategies for millions of
enterprise companies. Not only is Walrus low-cost, it also provides unmatched layers of data

availability, integrity, transparency, and resilience that centralized solutions by design cannot
o?er.

Walrus is powered by the Sui Network and scales horizontally to hundreds or thousands of
networked decentralized storage nodes. This should enable Walrus to o?er Exabytes of storage
at costs competitive with current centralized o?erings, given the higher assurance and
decentralization.

The Future of Walrus

By releasing this developer preview we hope to share some of the design decisions with the
decentralized app developer community and gather feedback on the approach and the APIs for
storing, retrieving, and certifying blobs. In this developer preview, all storage nodes are
operated by Mysten Labs to help us understand use cases, ?x bugs, and improve the
performance of the software.

Future updates to Walrus will allow for dynamically changing the set of decentralized storage
nodes, as well as changing the mapping of what slivers are managed by each storage node. The
available operations and tools will also be expanded to cover more storage-related use cases.
Many of these functions will be designed with the feedback we gather in mind.

Stay tuned for more updates on how Walrus will revolutionize data storage in the web3
ecosystem.

What can developers build?

As part of this developer preview, we provide a binary client (currently macOS, ubuntu) that can
be operated from the command line interface, a JSON API, and an HTTP API. We also o?er the
community an aggregator and publisher service and a Devnet deployment of 10 storage nodes
operated by Mysten Labs.

We hope developers will experiment with building applications that leverage the Walrus
Decentralized Store in a variety of ways. As examples, we hope to see the community build:

Storage of media for NFT or dapps: Walrus can directly store and serve media such as
images, sounds, sprites, videos, other game assets, etc. This is publicly available media

that can be accessed using HTTP requests at caches to create multimedia dapps.

AI-related use cases: Walrus can store clean data sets of training data, datasets with a
known and veri?ed provenance, model weights, and proofs of correct training for AI
models. Or it may be used to store and ensure the availability and authenticity of an AI
model output.

Storage of long term archival of blockchain history: Walrus can be used as a lower-
cost decentralized store to store blockchain history. For Sui, this can include sequences of
checkpoints with all associated transaction and e?ects content, as well as historic
snapshots of the blockchain state, code, or binaries.

Support availability for L2s: Walrus enables parties to certify the availability of blobs, as
required by L2s that need data to be stored and attested as available to all. This may also

include the availability of extra audit data such as validity proofs, zero-knowledge proofs
of correct execution, or large fraud proofs.

Support a full decentralized web experience: Walrus can host full decentralized web
experiences including all resources (such as js, css, html, and media). These can provide
content but also host the UX of dapps, enabling fully decentralized front- and back-ends
on chain. It brings the full "web" back into "web3".

Support subscription models for media: Creators can store encrypted media on Walrus
and only provide access via decryption keys to parties that have paid a subscription fee or
have paid for content. (Note that Walrus provides the storage; encryption and decryption
must be done o? Walrus).

We are excited to see what else the web3 developer community can imagine!

Getting Started

For this developer preview the public Walrus Devnet is openly available to all developers.
Developer documentation is available at https://docs.wal.app.

SUI Testnet token is the main currency for interacting with Walrus. Developers pay for Walrus
Devnet storage using SUI Testnet tokens which can be acquired at the Sui Testnet Discord
faucet.

Devnet Update

Published on: 2024-08-12

Warning

This blog post is shown in its original form and may contain information that is no longer
accurate. Some broken links may have been updated or removed.

We have redeployed the Walrus Devnet to incorporate various improvements to the Walrus
storage nodes and clients. In this process, all blobs stored on Walrus were wiped. Note that this
may happen again on Devnet and Testnet, but obviously not on the future Mainnet.

Migration and Re-deployment of Walrus Sites

You can obtain the latest version of the  walrus  binary and the new con?guration as described
in the setup chapter.

If you had deployed any Walrus Sites, the site object on Sui and any SuiNS name are still valid.

However, you need to re-store all blobs on Walrus. You can achieve this by running the site-
builder tool (from the  walrus-sites  directory) as follows:

./target/release/site-builder --config site-builder/assets/builder-example.yaml
update --force \
    <path to the site> <site object ID>

Changes

Besides many improvements to the storage nodes, the new version of Walrus includes the
following user-facing changes:

Improved coin management: The client now better selects coins for gas and storage fees.
Users no longer require multiple coins in their wallet.
Improved connection management: The client now limits the number of parallel
connections to improve performance for users with low network bandwidth storing large
blobs.

Walrus

OpenAPI speci?cation: Walrus storage nodes, aggregators, and publishers expose their
API speci?cations at the path  /v1/api .
System info in JSON: The  info  command is now also available in JSON mode.

Client version: The  walrus  CLI now has a  --version  option.
Support for the empty blob: The empty blob is now supported by Walrus.
Default con?guration-?le paths: The client now looks for con?guration ?les in
~/.config/walrus  in addition to  ~/.walrus  and recognizes the extension  .yml  in

addition to  .yaml .

Home directory in paths: Paths speci?ed in con?guration ?les now expand the  ~  symbol
at the beginning to the user's home directory.
More robust store and status check: The  store  and  blob-status  commands are now

more robust against Sui full nodes that aggressively prune past events and against load-
balancers that send transactions to di?erent full nodes.
Fix CLI parsing: The  walrus  CLI now properly handles hyphens in blob IDs.

This update also increases the number of shards to 1000, which is more representative of the
expected value in Testnet and Mainnet.

Announcing the O?cial Walrus Whitepaper

Published on: 2024-09-17

Warning

This blog post is shown in its original form and may contain information that is no longer
accurate. Some broken links may have been updated or removed.

In June, Mysten Labs announced Walrus, a new decentralized secure blob store design, and
introduced a developer preview that currently stores over 12TiB of data. Breaking the Ice
gathered over 200 developers to build apps leveraging decentralized storage.

It is time to unveil the next stage of the project: Walrus will become an independent
decentralized network with its own utility token, WAL, that will play a key role in the operation
and governance of the network. Walrus will be operated by storage nodes through a delegated
proof-of-stake mechanism using the WAL token. An independent Walrus foundation will
encourage the advancement and adoption of Walrus, and support its community of users and
developers.

Today, we published the Walrus whitepaper (also on GitHub) that o?ers additional details,
including:

The encoding scheme and Read / Write operations Walrus uses to ensure both security
and e?cient scaling to 100s and 1000s of storage nodes, including interactions with the
Sui blockchain which serves as a coordination layer for Walrus√Ü operations.
The recon?guration of storage nodes across epochs, and how the protocol ensures
available blobs on Walrus remain available over long periods of time.
The tokenomics of Walrus based on the WAL token, including how staking and staking
rewards are structured, how pricing and payments for storage are handled and
distributed in each epoch, and the governance of key system parameters.
Forward-looking design options, such as a cheap mechanism to challenge and audit
storage nodes, options for ensuring reads with a higher service quality, possibly against a
payment, and designs that empower light nodes to meaningfully contribute to the
protocol√Üs robustness, serve reads, and be rewarded.

The whitepaper focuses on the steady-state design aspects of Walrus. Further details about the
project, such as timelines, opportunities for community participation, how to join the network
as a storage node, and plans around light nodes, will be shared in subsequent posts.

Announcing Testnet

Published on: 2024-10-17

Warning

This blog post is mostly shown in its original form and may contain information that is no
longer accurate. Some broken links may have been updated or removed.

Today, a community of operators launches the ?rst public Walrus Testnet. This is an important
milestone in validating the operation of Walrus as a decentralized blob store, by operating it on
a set of independent storage nodes, that change over time through a delegated proof of stake
mechanism. The Testnet also brings functionality updates relating to governance, epochs, and
blob deletion.

Blob deletion

The most important user-facing new feature is optional blob deletion. The uploader of a blob
can optionally indicate a blob is "deletable". This information is stored in the Sui blob metadata
object, and is also included in the event denoting when the blob is certi?ed. Subsequently, the
owner of the Sui blob metadata object can "delete" it. As a result storage for the remaining
period is reclaimed and can be used by subsequent blob storage operations.

Blob deletion allows more ?ne-grained storage cost management: smart contracts that wrap

blob metadata objects can de?ne logic that stores blobs and delete them to minimize costs,
and reclaim storage space before Walrus epochs end.

However, blob deletion is not an e?ective privacy mechanism in itself: copies of the blob may
exist outside Walrus storage nodes on caches and end-user stores or devices. Furthermore, if
the identical blob is stored by multiple Walrus users, the blob will still be available on Walrus
until no copy exists. Thus deleting your own copy of a blob cannot guarantee that it is deleted
from Walrus as a whole.

Epochs

Walrus

Walrus Testnet enables multiple epochs. Initially, the epoch duration is set to a single day to
ensure the logic of epoch change is thoroughly tested. At Mainnet, epochs will likely be multiple
weeks long.

The progress of epochs makes the end epoch of blobs meaningful, and blobs will become
unavailable when they reach their end epoch. The store command may be used to extend the end
epoch of a blob that is still available. This operation is e?cient and only a?ects payments and
metadata, and does not re-upload blob contents.

Note

The previous paragraph was edited on 2025-07-16 for improved clarity.

Find out the current epoch through the CLI.
Find out how to store a blob for multiple epochs.

The WAL token and the Testnet WAL faucet

Payments for blob storage and extending blob expiry are denominated in Testnet WAL, a
Walrus token issued on the Sui Testnet. Testnet WAL has no value, and an unlimited supply; so
no need to covet or hoard it, it's just for testing purposes and only issued on Sui Testnet.

WAL also has a smaller unit called FROST, similar to MIST for SUI. 1 WAL is equal to 1 billion
(1000000000) FROST.

To make Testnet WAL available to all who want to experiment with the Walrus Testnet we
provide a utility and smart contract to convert Testnet SUI (which also has no value) into
Testnet WAL using a one-to-one exchange rate. This is chosen arbitrarily, and generally one
should not read too much into the actual WAL denominated costs of storage on Testnet. They
have been chosen arbitrarily.

Find out how to request Testnet WAL tokens through the CLI.

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Decentralization through staking & unstaking

The WAL token may also be used to stake with storage operators. Staked WAL can be unstaked
and re-staked with other operators or used to purchase storage.

Each epoch storage nodes are selected and allocated storage shards according to their
delegated stake. At the end of each epoch payments for storing blobs for the epoch are
distributed to storage nodes and those that delegate stake to them. Furthermore, important
network parameters (such as total available storage and storage price) are set by the selected
storage operators each epoch according to their stake weight.

A staking web dApp is provided to experiment with this functionality. Community members
have also created explorers that can be used to view storage nodes when considering who to
stake with. Staking ensures that the ultimate governance of Walrus, directly in terms of storage
nodes, and indirectly in terms of parameters and software they chose, rests with WAL Token
holders.

Under the hood and over the next months we will be testing many aspects of epoch changes
and storage node committee changes: better shard allocation mechanisms upon changes or
storage node stake; e?cient ways to sync state between storage nodes; as well as better ways
for storage nodes to follow Sui event streams.

Explore the Walrus staking dApp.
Look at recent activity on the Walrus Explorer.

New Move contracts & documentation

As part of the Testnet release of Walrus, the documentation and Move Smart contracts have
been updated, and can be found in the  walrus-docs  repository.

New Walrus Sites features

With the move to Walrus Testnet, Walrus Sites have also been updated! The new features in
this update greatly increase the ?exibility, speed, and security of Walrus Sites. Developers can
now specify client-side routing rules, and add custom HTTP headers to the portals' responses
for their site, expanding the possibilities for what Walrus Sites can do.

Migrate now to take advantage of these new features! The old Walrus Sites, based on Walrus
Devnet, will still be available for a short time. However, Devnet will be wiped soon (as described

below), so it is recommended to migrate as soon as possible.

Discontinuation of Walrus Devnet

The previous Walrus Devnet instance is now deprecated and will be shut down after 2024-10-
31. All data stored on Walrus Devnet (including Walrus Sites) will no longer be accessible at that
point. You need to re-upload all data to Walrus Testnet if you want it to remain accessible.
Walrus Sites also need to be migrated.

Announcing Testnet v2

Published on: 2025-01-16

Warning

This blog post is shown in its original form and may contain information that is no longer
accurate. Some broken links may have been updated or removed.

We are today redeploying the Walrus Testnet to incorporate various improvements, including

some backwards-incompatible changes. Make sure to get the latest binary and con?guration as
described in the setup section.

Note that all blob data on the previous Testnet instance has been wiped. All blobs need to be
re-uploaded to the new Testnet instance, including Walrus Sites. In addition, there is a new
version of the WAL token, so your previous WAL tokens will not work anymore. To use the
Testnet v2, you need to obtain new WAL tokens.

In the following sections, we describe the notable changes and the actions required for existing
Walrus Sites.

Epoch duration

The epoch duration has been increased from one day to two days to emphasize that this
duration is di?erent from Sui epochs (at Mainnet, epochs will likely be multiple weeks long). In
addition, the maximum number of epochs a blob can be stored for has been reduced from 200
to 183 (corresponding to one year).

The  walrus store  command now also supports the  --epochs max  ?ag, which will store the
blob for the maximum number of epochs. Note that the  --epochs  ?ag is now mandatory.

New features

Besides many improvements to the contracts and the storage-node service, the latest Walrus
release also brings several user-facing improvements.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

17/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

The  walrus store  command now supports storing multiple ?les at once. This is faster
and more cost-e?ective compared to storing each ?le separately as transactions can be
batched through PTBs. Notably, this is compatible with glob patterns o?ered by many
shells, so you can for example run a command like  walrus store *.png --epochs 100  to
store all PNG ?les in the current directory.
The  walrus  CLI now supports creating, funding, and extending shared blobs using the
walrus share ,  walrus store --share , and  walrus fund-shared-blob  commands.
Shared blobs are an example of collectively managed and funded blobs. See the shared
blobs section for more details.

New WAL token

Along with the redeployment of Walrus, we have also deployed a fresh WAL contract. This
means that you cannot use any WAL token from the previous Testnet instance with the new
Testnet instance. You need to request new WAL tokens through the Testnet WAL faucet.

Backwards-incompatible changes

One reason for a full redeployment is to allow us to make some changes that are backwards-
incompatible. Many of those are related to the contracts and thus less visible to users. There
are, however, some changes that may a?ect you.

Con?guration ?les

The format of the con?guration ?les for storage nodes and clients has been changed. Make
sure to use the latest version of the con?guration ?les, see the con?guration section.

CLI options

Several CLI options of the  walrus  CLI have been changed. Notably, all "short" variants of

options (e.g.,  -e  instead of  --epochs ) have been removed to prevent future confusion with
new options. Additionally, the  --epochs  ?ag is now mandatory for the  walrus store
command (this also a?ects the JSON API).

Please refer to the CLI help ( walrus --help , or  walrus <command> --help ) for further details.

HTTP APIs

Walrus

The paths, request, and response formats of the HTTP APIs have changed for the storage
nodes, and also the aggregator and publisher. Please refer to the section on the HTTP API for
further details.

E?ects on and actions required for existing Walrus Sites

The Walrus Sites contracts have not changed, which means that all corresponding objects on
Sui are still valid. However, the resources now point to blob IDs that do not yet exist on the new

Testnet. The easiest way to ?x existing sites is to simply update them with the  --force  ?ag:

site-builder update --epochs <number of epochs> --force <path to site> <existing
site object>

New Move contracts & documentation

As part of the new Testnet release of Walrus, the Move smart contracts have been updated; the
deployed version can be found in the  walrus-docs  repository.

Announcing Mainnet

Published on: 2025-03-27

A decentralized network: Mainnet

The production Walrus Mainnet is now live, and operated by a decentralized network of over
100 storage nodes. Epoch 1 begun on March 25, 2025. The network can now be used to publish
and retrieve blobs, upload and browse Walrus Sites, as well as stake and unstake to determine
future committees using the live Mainnet WAL token. On Mainnet, the Walrus security
properties hold. And Walrus is now ready to satisfy the needs of real applications.

Walrus is open source. The Walrus protocol health is overseen by an independent foundation
that is now well resourced to support future development and growth. And, the community is
collecting tools, resources and dapps for Walrus under Awesome Walrus!

This is a signi?cant milestone a little over 12 months after an initial small team started
designing the Walrus protocol. And a special thanks is due to the community of storage
operators that supported the development of Walrus through consecutive Testnet(s), as well as
all community members that integrated the protocol early and provided feedback to improve
it.

New features

Besides the promise of stability and security, the Mainnet release of Walrus comes with a few
notable new features and changes:

Blob attributes. Each Sui blob objects can have multiple attributes and values attached
to it, to encode application meta-data. The aggregator uses this facility for returning
common HTTP headers.

Burn blob objects on Sui. The command line  walrus  tool is extended with commands to
"burn" Sui blob objects to reclaim the associated storage fee, making it cheaper to store
blobs.

CLI expiry time improvements. Now blob expiry can be expressed more ?exibly when
storing blobs, through  --epochs max , an RFC3339 date with  --earliest-expiry-time , or

the concrete end epoch with  --end-epoch .

Walrus

RedStu? with Reed-Solomon codes. The erasure code underlying RedStu? was changed
from RaptorQ to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Intense benchmarking suggests their
performance, for our parameter set, is similar, and the use of RS codes provides perfect
robustness, in that blobs can always be reconstructed given a threshold of slivers. We
thank Joachim Neu for extensive feedback on this topic.

TLS handing for storage node. Storage nodes can now be con?gured to serve TLS
certi?cates that are publicly trusted, such as those issues by cloud providers and public
authorities such as Let's Encrypt. This allows JavaScript clients to directly store and
retrieve blobs from Walrus.

JWT authentication for publisher. Now the publisher can be con?gured to only provide
services to authenticated users via consuming JWT tokens that can be distributed through
any authentication mechanism.

Extensive logging and metrics. All services, from the storage node to aggregator and
publisher export metrics that can be used to build dashboards, and logs at multiple levels
to troubleshoot their operation.

Health endpoint. Storage nodes and the CLI include a  health  command to check the

status and basic information of storage nodes. This is useful when allocating stake as well
as monitoring the network.

Walrus Sites updates. The Mainnet Walrus Sites public portal will be hosted on the
wal.app  domain name. Now Walrus Sites support deletable blobs to make their updates
more capital e?cient. Those operating their own portals may also use their own domain
names to serve a Walrus Site. The Staking, Docs, Snowreads, and Flatland Walrus Sites are
now on Mainnet.

A subsidies contract. The Mainnet release of Walrus requires WAL for storing blobs,
however to enable early adopters to try the system, transition to it, the Walrus foundation
operates a smart contract to acquire subsidized storage. The CLI client uses it
automatically when storing blobs.

Testnet future plans

The current Walrus Testnet will soon be wiped and restarted to align the codebase to the
Mainnet release. Going forward we will regularly wipe the Testnet, every few months.
Developers should use the Walrus Mainnet to get any level of stability. The Walrus Testnet is
only there to test new features before they are deployed in production.

Walrus

We will not be operating a public portal to serve Walrus Sites on Testnet, to reduce costs and
incident response associated with free web hosting. Developers can still run a local portal
pointed to Testnet to test Walrus Sites.

Open source Walrus codebase

The Walrus codebase, including all smart contracts in Move, services in Rust, and
documentation, is now open sourced under an Apache 2.0 license, and hosted on GitHub. Since
the main Walrus repository is now open to all, and contains both documentation and smart
contracts, we are retiring the  walrus-docs  repository.

Developers may ?nd the Rust CLI client, and associated aggregator and publisher services of
most interest. These can be extended to specialize services to speci?c operational needs. They
are also a good illustration of how to interface with Walrus using Rust clients. A cleaner and
more stable Rust SDK is in the works as well.

Publisher improvements and plans

Publishing blobs on Mainnet consumes real WAL and SUI. To avoid uncontrolled costs to
operations the publisher service was augmented with facilities to authenticate requests and
account for costs per user.

Setup

We provide a pre-compiled  walrus  client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu,

which supports di?erent usage patterns (see the next chapter). This chapter describes the
prerequisites, installation, and con?guration of the Walrus client.

Walrus is open-source under an Apache 2 license, and can also be built and installed from the

Rust source code via cargo.

Walrus networks

This page describes how to connect to Walrus Mainnet. See Available networks for an
overview over all Walrus networks.

Prerequisites: Sui wallet, SUI and WAL

Quick wallet setup

If you just want to set up a new Sui wallet for Walrus, you can generate one using the
walrus generate-sui-wallet --network mainnet  command after installing Walrus. You

still need to obtain some SUI and WAL tokens, but you do not have to install the Sui CLI.

Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui wallet with some amount of SUI and WAL tokens.
The normal way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the installation instructions in the Sui
documentation.

After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a wallet by running  sui client , which prompts
you to set up a new con?guration. Make sure to point it to Sui Mainnet, you can use the full
node at  https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443  for this. See the Sui documentation for
further details.

After this, you should get something like this (everything besides the  mainnet  line is optional):

Make sure you have at least one gas coin with at least 1 SUI.

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Finally, to publish blobs on Walrus you will need some Mainnet WAL to pay for storage and
upload costs. You can buy WAL through a variety of centralized or decentralized exchanges.

The system-wide wallet will be used by Walrus if no other path is speci?ed. If you want to use a
di?erent Sui wallet, you can specify this in the Walrus con?guration ?le or when running the
CLI.

Walrus

To download and install  walrus  to your  "$HOME"/.local/bin  directory, run one of the
following commands in your terminal then follow on-screen instructions. If you are on
Windows, see the Windows-speci?c instructions or the  suiup  installation (experimental)

# Run a first-time install using the latest Mainnet version.
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh

# Install the latest Testnet version instead.
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -n testnet

# Update an existing installation (overwrites prior version of walrus).
curl -sSf https://install.wal.app | sh -s -- -f

Make sure that the  "$HOME"/.local/bin  directory is in your  $PATH .

Once this is done, you should be able to run Walrus by using the  walrus  command in your

terminal.

You can see usage instructions as follows (see the next chapter for further details):

$ walrus --help

Walrus

Build from source

Walrus is open-source software published under the Apache 2 license. The code is developed in
a  git  repository at https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus.

The latest version of Mainnet and Testnet are available under the branches  mainnet  and

testnet  respectively, and the latest version under the  main  branch. We welcome reports of

issues and bug ?xes. Follow the instructions in the  README.md  ?le to build and use Walrus from
source.

Con?guration

The Walrus client needs to know about the Sui objects that store the Walrus system and staking
information, see the developer guide. These need to be con?gured in a ?le
~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml . Additionally, a  subsidies  object can be speci?ed,

which will subsidize storage bought with the client.

You can access Testnet and Mainnet via the following con?guration. Note that this example
Walrus CLI con?guration refers to the standard location for Sui con?guration
( "~/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml" ).

Testnet con?guration

Disclaimer about the Walrus Testnet

All transactions are executed on the Sui Testnet and use Testnet WAL and SUI which have

no value. The state of the store can and will be wiped at any point and possibly with no
warning. Do not rely on this Testnet for any production purposes, it comes with no
availability or persistence guarantees.

New features on testnet may break deployed testnet apps, since this is the network in
which we test new updates including for compatibility with eco-system applications.

Also see the Testnet terms of service under which this Testnet is made available.

Prerequisites: Sui wallet and Testnet SUI

Interacting with Walrus requires a valid Sui Testnet wallet with some amount of SUI tokens. The
normal way to set this up is via the Sui CLI; see the installation instructions in the Sui
documentation. If you do not want to install the Sui CLI, you can also generate a new Sui wallet
for Testnet using  walrus generate-sui-wallet --network testnet .

After installing the Sui CLI, you need to set up a Testnet wallet by running  sui client , which

prompts you to set up a new con?guration. Make sure to point it to Sui Testnet, you can use

for further details.

If you already have a Sui wallet con?gured, you can directly set up the Testnet environment (if
you don't have it yet),

sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443

and switch the active environment to it:

sui client switch --env testnet

After this, you should get something like this (everything besides the  testnet  line is optional):

Finally, make sure you have at least one gas coin with at least 1 SUI. You can obtain one from
the Sui Testnet faucet (you can ?nd your address through the  sui client active-address

command).

After some seconds, you should see your new SUI coins:

Testnet WAL faucet

The Walrus Testnet uses Testnet WAL tokens to buy storage and stake. Testnet WAL tokens
have no value and can be exchanged (at a 1:1 rate) for some Testnet SUI tokens, which also
have no value, through the following command:

walrus get-wal

You can check that you have received Testnet WAL by checking the Sui balances:

$ sui client balance
???????????????????????????????????????????
? Balance of coins owned by this address  ?
???????????????????????????????????????????
? ??????????????????????????????????????? ?
? ? coin  balance (raw)     balance     ? ?

? ? WAL   500000000         0.50 WAL    ? ?
? ??????????????????????????????????????? ?
???????????????????????????????????????????

By default, 0.5 SUI are exchanged for 0.5 WAL, but a di?erent amount of SUI may be exchanged
using the  --amount  option (the value is in MIST/FROST), and a speci?c SUI/WAL exchange
object may be used through the  --exchange-id  option. The  walrus get-wal --help

command provides more information about those.

In addition to publicly deployed Walrus networks, you can deploy a Walrus testbed on your
local machine for local testing. All you need to do is run the script  scripts/local-testbed.sh
found in the Walrus git code repository. See  scripts/local-testbed.sh -h  for further usage

information.

The script generates con?guration that you can use when running the Walrus client and prints
the path to that con?guration ?le.

In addition, one can spin up a local grafana instance to visualize the metrics collected by the
storage nodes. This can be done via  cd docker/grafana-local; docker compose up . This

should work with the default storage node con?guration.

Note that while the Walrus storage nodes of this testbed run on your local machine, the Sui
Devnet is used by default to deploy and interact with the contracts. To run the testbed fully
locally, simply start a local network with  sui start --with-faucet --force-regenesis

(requires  sui  to be  v1.28.0  or higher) and specify  localnet  when starting the Walrus

testbed.

Interacting with Walrus

We provide 3 ways to interact directly with the Walrus storage system:

Through the Walrus client command line interface (CLI).
Through a JSON API of the Walrus CLI.
Through an HTTP API exposed by a public or local Walrus client daemon.

Furthermore, users can stake and unstake through the staking dApp or Sui smart contracts.

Walrus

Using the Walrus client

The  walrus  binary can be used to interact with Walrus as a client. See the setup chapter for
prerequisites, installation, and con?guration.

Detailed usage information including a full list of available commands can be viewed with

walrus --help

Each sub-command of  walrus  can also be called with  --help  to print its speci?c arguments

and their meaning.

If you have multiple contexts in your con?guration ?le (as in the default one included on the
setup page), you can specify the context for each command through the  --context  option.

You can generate a bash/zsh/?sh completion script with  walrus completion  and place it in the

appropriate directory like  ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions .

Walrus system information

Information about the Walrus system is available through the  walrus info  command. It
provides an overview of current system parameters such as the current epoch, the number of
storage nodes and shards in the system, the maximum blob size, and the current cost in WAL
for storing blobs:

End time: 2025-04-08 15:00:24.408 UTC
Epoch duration: 14days
Blobs can be stored for at most 53 epochs in the future.

Storage nodes
Number of storage nodes: 103
Number of shards: 1000

Blob size
Maximum blob size: 13.6 GiB (14,599,533,452 B)
Storage unit: 1.00 MiB

Storage prices per epoch
(Conversion rate: 1 WAL = 1,000,000,000 FROST)
Price per encoded storage unit: 0.0001 WAL
Additional price for each write: 20,000 FROST

...

Epoch duration

The epoch duration on Mainnet is 2 weeks. See here for other parameters on Mainnet and
Testnet.

FROST and WAL

FROST is the smaller unit of WAL, similar to MIST for SUI. The conversion is also the same as
for SUI:  1 WAL = 1 000 000 000 FROST .

Additional information such as encoding parameters and sizes, BFT system information, and
information on the storage nodes in the current and (if already selected) the next committee,
including their node IDs and stake and shard distribution can be viewed with various
subcommands, see  walrus info --help  for details. Note that the previous  --dev  option has

been replaced by the  all  subcommand.

The health of storage nodes can be checked with the  walrus health  command. This

command takes di?erent options to select the nodes to check (see  walrus health --help  for

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

Walrus

details). For example,  walrus health --committee  checks the status of all current committee

members.

Storing blobs

Public access

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all. Therefore you must not
use Walrus to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional
measures to protect con?dentiality.

Warning

It must be ensured that only a single process uses the Sui wallet for write actions (storing or
deleting). When using multiple instances of the client simultaneously, each of them must be
pointed to a di?erent wallet. Note, it is possible to store multiple blobs with a single  walrus

store  command.

Storing one or multiple blobs on Walrus can be achieved through the following command:

walrus store <FILES> --epochs <EPOCHS>

A mandatory CLI argument must be set to specify the lifetime for the blob. There are currently
three ways for this:

1. The  --epochs <EPOCHS>  option indicates the number of epochs the blob should be

stored for. There is an upper limit on the number of epochs a blob can be stored for,
which is 53, corresponding to two years. In addition to a positive integer, you can also use
--epochs max  to store the blob for the maximum number of epochs. Note that the end

epoch is de?ned as the current epoch plus the speci?ed number of epochs.

2. The  --earliest-expiry-time <EARLIEST_EXPIRY_TIME>  option takes a date in RFC3339

format (e.g., "2024-03-20T15:00:00Z") or a more relaxed format (e.g., "2024-03-20
15:00:00") and ensures the blob expires after that date if possible.

3. The  --end-epoch <END_EPOCH>  option takes a speci?c end epoch for the blob.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

41/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

End epoch

A blob expires at the beginning of its end epoch. For example, a blob with end epoch  314  will

become unavailable at the beginning of epoch  314 . One consequence of this is that when
storing a blob with  --epochs 1  immediately before an epoch change, it will expire and

become unavailable almost immediately. Note that blobs can be extended only if they have
not expired.

You can store a single ?le or multiple ?les, separated by spaces. Notably, this is compatible with
glob patterns; for example,  walrus store *.png --epochs <EPOCHS>  will store all PNG ?les in

the current directory.

By default, the command will store the blob as a permanent blob, although this is going to
change in the near future. See the section on deletable blobs for more details on deletable
blobs. Also, by default an owned  Blob  object is created. It is possible to wrap this into a shared

object, which can be funded and extended by anyone, see the shared blobs section.

When storing a blob, the client performs a number of automatic optimizations, including the

following:

If the blob is already stored as a permanent blob on Walrus for a su?cient number of
epochs the command does not store it again. This behavior can be overwritten with the  -

-force  CLI option, which stores the blob again and creates a fresh blob object on Sui
belonging to the wallet address.

If the user's wallet has a storage resource of suitable size and duration, it is (re-)used
instead of buying a new one.
If the blob is already certi?ed on Walrus but as a deletable blob or not for a su?cient
number of epochs, the command skips sending encoded blob data to the storage nodes
and just collects the availability certi?cate

Costs

We have a separate page with some considerations regarding cost.

Querying blob status

The status of a blob can be queried through one of the following commands:

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

42/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

walrus blob-status --blob-id <BLOB_ID>
walrus blob-status --file <FILE>

This returns whether the blob is stored and its availability period. If you specify a ?le with the  -

-file  option,the CLI re-encodes the content of the ?le and derives the blob ID before checking

the status.

When the blob is available, the  blob-status  command also returns the  BlobCertified  Sui

event ID, which consists of a transaction ID and a sequence number in the events emitted by
the transaction. The existence of this event certi?es the availability of the blob.

Reading blobs

Reading blobs from Walrus can be achieved through the following command:

walrus read <some blob ID>

By default the blob data is written to the standard output. The  --out <OUT>  CLI option can be

used to specify an output ?le name. The  --rpc-url <URL>  may be used to specify a Sui RPC
node to use instead of the one set in the wallet con?guration or the default one.

Extending the lifetime of a blob

Recall that when you stored your blob, it was necessary to specify its end epoch. By specifying
the end epoch you ensured that the blob would be available via  walrus read  (or other SDK
access to Walrus) until that end epoch is reached.

Walrus blob lifetimes can be extended as long as the blobs are not expired using the  walrus

extend --blob-obj-id <blob object id> ...  command. Both regular single-address owned
blobs and shared blobs may be extended. Shared blobs may be extended by anyone, but
owned blobs may only be extended by their owner. When extending a shared blob, you will
need to supply the  --shared  ?ag to inform the command that the blob is shared.

Note that the blob's object ID will be needed in order to extend it, the blob ID is not needed. See
walrus extend --help  for more information on blob extension.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

43/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Reclaiming space via deletable blobs

By default  walrus store  uploads a permanent blob available until after its expiry epoch. Not

even the uploader may delete it beforehand. However, optionally, the store command may be
invoked with the  --deletable  ?ag, to indicate the blob may be deleted before its expiry by the

owner of the Sui blob object representing the blob. Deletable blobs are indicated as such in the
Sui events that certify them, and should not be relied upon for availability by others.

A deletable blob may be deleted with the command:

walrus delete --blob-id <BLOB_ID>

Optionally the delete command can be invoked by specifying a  --file <PATH>  option, to

derive the blob ID from a ?le, or  --object-id <SUI_ID>  to delete the blob in the Sui blob

object speci?ed.

Before deleting a blob, the  walrus delete  command will ask for con?rmation unless the  --
yes  option is speci?ed.

The  delete  command reclaims the storage object associated with the deleted blob, which is

re-used to store new blobs. The delete operation provides ?exibility around managing storage
costs and re-using storage.

The delete operation has limited utility for privacy: It only deletes slivers from the current
epoch storage nodes, and subsequent epoch storage nodes, if no other user has uploaded a
copy of the same blob. If another copy of the same blob exists in Walrus, the delete operation
will not make the blob unavailable for download, and  walrus read  invocations will download

it. After the deletion is ?nished, the CLI checks the updated status of the blob to see if it is still
accessible in Walrus (unless the  --no-status-check  option is speci?ed). However, even if it

isn't, copies of the public blob may be cached or downloaded by users, and these copies are
not deleted.

Delete reclaims space only

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all. The  delete  command will

not delete slivers if other copies of the blob are stored on Walrus possibly by other users. It
does not delete blobs from caches, slivers from past storage nodes, or copies that could
have been made by users before the blob was deleted.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

44/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Shared blobs

Shared blobs are shared Sui objects wrapping "standard"  Blob  objects that can be funded and

whose lifetime can be extended by anyone. See the shared blobs contracts for further details.

You can create a shared blob from an existing  Blob  object you own with the  walrus share

command:

walrus share --blob-obj-id <BLOB_OBJ_ID>

The resulting shared blob can be directly funded by adding an  --amount , or you can fund an

existing shared blob with the  walrus fund-shared-blob  command. Additionally, you can
immediately share a newly created blob by adding the  --share  option to the  walrus store

command.

Shared blobs can only contain permanent blobs and as such cannot be deleted before their
expiry.

See this section for more on blob extension.

Batch-storing blobs with quilts

Note: The quilt feature is only available in Walrus version v1.29 or higher.

Warning

Blobs within a quilt are retrieved by a  QuiltPatchId , not their standard  BlobId . This

ID is generated based on all blobs in the quilt, so a blob's  QuiltPatchId  will change if

it's moved to a di?erent quilt.
Standard blob operations like  delete ,  extend , or  share  cannot target individual
blobs inside a quilt; they must be applied to the entire quilt.

For e?ciently storing large numbers of small blobs, Walrus provides the Quilt. It batches
multiple blobs into a single storage unit, signi?cantly reducing overhead and cost. You can ?nd

a more detailed overview of the feature Quilt.

You can interact with quilts using a dedicated set of  walrus  subcommands.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

45/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Storing Blobs as a Quilt

To batch-store multiple ?les as a single quilt, use the  store-quilt  command. You can specify
the ?les to include in two ways:

Warning

You must ensure that all the identi?ers are unique within a quilt, the operation will fail
otherwise. Identi?ers are the unique names used to retrieve individual blobs from within a

quilt.

Using --paths

To store all ?les from one or more directories recursively. The ?lename of each ?le will be used
as its unique identi?er within the quilt. Regular expressions are supported for uploading from
multiple paths, same as the  walrus store  command.

Like the regular  store  command, you can specify the storage duration using  --epochs ,  --

earliest-expiry-time , or  --end-epoch .

walrus store-quilt --epochs <EPOCHS> --paths <path-to-directory-1> <path-to-
directory-2> <path-to-blob>

Using --blobs

To specify a list of blobs as JSON objects. This gives you more control, allowing you to set a
custom  identifier  and  tags  for each ?le. If  identifier  is  null  or omitted, the ?le's name

is used instead.

walrus store-quilt \
  --blobs '{"path":"<path-to-blob-1>","identifier":"walrus","tags":
{"color":"grey","size":"medium"}}' \
          '{"path":"<path-to_blob-2>","identifier":"seal","tags":
{"color":"grey","size":"small"}}' \
  --epochs <EPOCHS>

Reading Blobs from a Quilt

You can retrieve individual blobs (formally "patches") from a quilt without downloading the

entire quilt. The  read-quilt  command allows you to query for speci?c blobs by their identi?er,

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

46/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

tags, or unique patch ID.

To read blobs by their identi?ers, use the  --identifiers  ?ag:

walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
  --quilt-id 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik --identifiers walrus.jpg
another-walrus.jpg

Blobs within a quilt can be accessed and ?ltered based on their tags. For instance, if you have a
collection of animal images stored in a quilt, each labeled with a species tag such as
"species=cat," you can download all images labeled as cats with the following command:

# Read all blobs with tag "size: medium"
walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
  --quilt-id 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik --tag species cat

You can also read a blob using its QuiltPatchId, which can be retrieved using  list-patches-in-

quilt .

walrus read-quilt --out <download dir> \
  --quilt-patch-ids GRSuRSQ_hLYR9nyo7mlBlS7MLQVSSXRrfPVOxF6n6XcBuQG8AQ \
  GRSuRSQ_hLYR9nyo7mlBlS7MLQVSSXRrfPVOxF6n6XcBwgHHAQ

List patches in a Quilt

To see all the patches contained within a quilt, along with their identi?ers and QuiltPatchIds,
use the  list-patches-in-quilt  command.

walrus list-patches-in-quilt 057MX9PAaUIQLliItM_khR_cp5jPHzJWf-CuJr1z1ik

Blob object and blob ID utilities

The command  walrus blob-id <FILE>  may be used to derive the blob ID of any ?le. The blob

ID is a commitment to the ?le, and any blob with the same ID will decode to the same content.
The blob ID is a 256 bit number and represented on some Sui explorer as a decimal large
number. The command  walrus convert-blob-id <BLOB_ID_DECIMAL>  may be used to convert

it to a base64 URL safe encoding used by the command line tools and other APIs.

The  walrus list-blobs  command lists all the non expired Sui blob object that the current

account owns, including their blob ID, object ID, and metadata about expiry and deletable

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

47/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

status. The option  --include-expired  also lists expired blob objects.

The Sui storage cost associated with blob objects may be reclaimed by burning the Sui blob
object. This does not lead to the Walrus blob being deleted, but means that operations such as

extending its lifetime, deleting it, or modifying attributes are no more available. The  walrus

burn-blobs --object-ids <BLOB_OBJ_IDS>  command may be used to burn a speci?c list of

blobs object IDs. The  --all  ?ag burns all blobs under the user account, and  --all-expired
burns all expired blobs under the user account.

Blob attributes

Walrus allows a set of key-value attribute pairs to be associated with a blob object. While the

key and values may be arbitrary strings to accommodate any needs of dapps, speci?c keys are
converted to HTTP headers when serving blobs through aggregators. Each aggregator can
decide which headers it allows through the  --allowed-headers  CLI option; the defaults can be

viewed through  walrus aggregator --help .

The command

walrus set-blob-attribute <BLOB_OBJ_ID> --attr "key1" "value1" --attr "key2"
"value2"

sets attributes  key1  and  key2  to values  value1  and  value2 , respectively. The command

walrus get-blob-attribute <BLOB_OBJ_ID>  returns all attributes associated with a blob ID.
Finally,

walrus remove-blob-attribute-fields <BLOB_OBJ_ID> --keys "key1,key2"

deletes the attributes with keys listed (separated by commas or spaces). All attributes of a blob
object may be deleted by the command  walrus remove-blob-attribute <BLOB_OBJ_ID> .

Note that attributes are associated with blob object IDs on Sui, rather than the blob themselves
on Walrus. This means that the gas for storage is reclaimed by deleting attributes. And also that
the same blob contents may have di?erent attributes for di?erent blob objects for the same
blob ID.

Changing the default con?guration

Use the  --config  option to specify a custom path to the con?guration location.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

48/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

The  --wallet <WALLET>  argument may be used to specify a non-standard Sui wallet

con?guration ?le. And a  --gas-budget <GAS_BUDGET>  argument may be used to change the

maximum amount of Sui (in MIST) that the command is allowed to use.

Logging and metrics

The  walrus  CLI allows for multiple levels of logging, which can be turned on via an env

variable:

RUST_LOG=walrus=trace walrus info

By default  info  level logs are enabled, but  debug  and  trace  can give a more intimate

understanding of what a command does, or how it fails.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

49/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

JSON mode

All Walrus client commands are also available in JSON mode. In this mode, all the command-
line ?ags of the original CLI command can be speci?ed in JSON format. The JSON mode
therefore simpli?es programmatic access to the CLI.

For example, to store a blob, run:

walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "store": {
                "files": ["README.md", "LICENSE"],
                "epochs": 100
            }
        }
    }'

Or, to read a blob knowing the blob ID:

walrus json \
    '{
        "config": "path/to/client_config.yaml",
        "command": {
            "read": {
                "blobId": "4BKcDC0Ih5RJ8R0tFMz3MZVNZV8b2goT6_JiEEwNHQo"
            }
        }
    }'

All options, default values, and commands are equal to those of the "standard" CLI mode,
except that they are written in "camelCase" instead of "kebab-case".

The  json  command also accepts input from  stdin .

The output of a  json  command will itself be JSON-formatted, again to simplify parsing the

results in a programmatic way. For example, the JSON output can be piped to the  jq

command for parsing and manually extracting relevant ?elds.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Client Daemon mode & HTTP API

In addition to the CLI and JSON modes, the Walrus client o?ers a daemon mode. In this mode, it
runs a simple web server o?ering HTTP interfaces to store and read blobs in an aggregator and
publisher role respectively. We also o?er public aggregator and publisher services to try the
Walrus HTTP APIs without the need to run a local client. See how to operate an aggregator or
publisher in the operator documentation.

HTTP API Usage

For the following examples, we assume you set the  AGGREGATOR  and  PUBLISHER  environment

variables to your desired aggregator and publisher, respectively. For example, the instances
run by Mysten Labs on Walrus Testnet (see below for further public options):

AGGREGATOR=https://aggregator.walrus-testnet.walrus.space
PUBLISHER=https://publisher.walrus-testnet.walrus.space

API speci?cation

Walrus aggregators and publishers expose their API speci?cations at the path  /v1/api .

You can view this in the browser, for example, at https://aggregator.walrus-
testnet.walrus.space/v1/api.

Store

You can interact with the daemon through simple HTTP PUT requests. For example, with cURL,
you can store blobs using a publisher or daemon as follows:

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

51/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

# store the string `some string` for 1 storage epoch
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs" -d "some string"
# store file `some/file` for 5 storage epochs
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs?epochs=5" --upload-file "some/file"
# store file `some/file` and send the blob object to $ADDRESS
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs?send_object_to=$ADDRESS" --upload-file
"some/file"
# store file `some/file` as a deletable blob, instead of a permanent one and send
the blob object to $ADDRESS
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs?deletable=true&send_object_to=$ADDRESS" --upload-
file "some/file"

The store HTTP API end points return information about the blob stored in JSON format. When
a blob is stored for the ?rst time, a  newlyCreated  ?eld contains information about the new

blob:

$ curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs" -d "some other string"
{
  "newlyCreated": {
    "blobObject": {
      "id": "0xe91eee8c5b6f35b9a250cfc29e30f0d9e5463a21fd8d1ddb0fc22d44db4eac50",
      "registeredEpoch": 34,
      "blobId": "M4hsZGQ1oCktdzegB6HnI6Mi28S2nqOPHxK-W7_4BUk",
      "size": 17,
      "encodingType": "RS2",
      "certifiedEpoch": 34,
      "storage": {
        "id":
"0x4748cd83217b5ce7aa77e7f1ad6fc5f7f694e26a157381b9391ac65c47815faf",
        "startEpoch": 34,
        "endEpoch": 35,
        "storageSize": 66034000
      },
      "deletable": false
    },
    "resourceOperation": {

        "epochsAhead": 1
      }
    },
    "cost": 132300
  }
}

The information returned is the content of the Sui blob object.

When the publisher ?nds a certi?ed blob with the same blob ID and a su?cient validity period,
it returns a  alreadyCertified  JSON structure:

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

52/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

$ curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/blobs" -d "some other string"

  "alreadyCertified": {
    "blobId": "M4hsZGQ1oCktdzegB6HnI6Mi28S2nqOPHxK-W7_4BUk",
    "event": {
      "txDigest": "4XQHFa9S324wTzYHF3vsBSwpUZuLpmwTHYMFv9nsttSs",
      "eventSeq": "0"
    },
    "endEpoch": 35
  }
}

The ?eld  event  returns the Sui event ID that can be used to ?nd the transaction that created

the Sui Blob object on the Sui explorer or using a Sui SDK.

Read

Blobs may be read from an aggregator or daemon using HTTP GET using their blob ID. For
example, the following cURL command reads a blob and writes it to an output ?le:

curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<some blob ID>" -o <some file name>

Alternatively you may print the contents of a blob in the terminal with the cURL command:

curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/<some blob ID>"

Content sni?ng

Modern browsers will attempt to sni? the content type for such resources, and will
generally do a good job of inferring content types for media. However, the aggregator on
purpose prevents such sni?ng from inferring dangerous executable types such as
JavaScript or style sheet types.

Blobs may also be read by using the object ID of a Sui blob object or a shared blob. For

example the following cURL command downloads the blob corresponding to a Sui blob with a
speci?c object ID:

curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-object-id/<object-id>" -o <some file name>

Downloading blobs by object ID allows the use of attributes to set some HTTP headers. The
aggregator recognizes the attribute keys  content-disposition ,  content-encoding ,  content-

language ,  content-location ,  content-type , and  link , and when present returns the values
in the corresponding HTTP headers.

Quilt HTTP APIs

Walrus supports storing and retrieving multiple blobs as a single unit called a quilt. The
publishers and aggregators support quilt related operations.

Note Quilt APIs are supported with Walrus 1.29 and higher.

Storing quilts

Tip

All the query parameters available for storing regular blobs (see Store section above) can
also be used when storing quilts.

Use the following publisher API to store multiple blobs as a quilt:

# Store two files `document.pdf` and `image.png`, with custom identifiers
`contract-v2` and
# `logo-2024, respectively.
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/quilts?epochs=5" \
  -F "contract-v2=@document.pdf" \
  -F "logo-2024=@image.png"

# Store two files with Walrus-native metadata. The metadata are assigned to the
blob with
# the same identifier. Note: `_metadata` must be used as the field name for
Walrus-native metadata.
curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/quilts?epochs=5" \
  -F "quilt-manual=@document.pdf" \
  -F "logo-2025=@image.png" \
  -F '_metadata=[
    {"identifier": "quilt-manual", "tags": {"creator": "walrus", "version":
"1.0"}},
    {"identifier": "logo-2025", "tags": {"type": "logo", "format": "png"}}
  ]'

Warning

Identi?ers must be unique within a quilt.

Walrus

Since identi?ers cannot start with  _ , the ?eld name  _metadata  is reserved for Walrus
native metadata and won't con?ict with user-de?ned identi?ers. See Quilt documentation
for complete identi?er restrictions.

The quilt store API returns a JSON response with information about the stored quilt, including
the quilt ID (blobId) and individual blob patch IDs that can be used to retrieve speci?c blobs
later. The following example shows the command and response (the actual JSON output is

Reading quilts

There are two ways to retrieve blobs from a quilt via the aggregator APIs:

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

56/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Info

Walrus

Currently, only one blob can be retrieved per request. Bulk retrieval of multiple blobs from
a quilt in a single request is not yet supported.

By quilt patch ID

Each blob in a quilt has a unique patch ID. You can retrieve a speci?c blob using its patch ID:

# Retrieve a blob using its quilt patch ID.
curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-quilt-patch-id/6XUOE-Q5-
nAXHRifN6n9nomVDtHZQbGuAkW3PjlBuKoBAQDQAA" \

Tip

QuiltPatchIds can be obtained from the store quilt output (as shown above) or by using the

list-patches-in-quilt  CLI command.

By quilt ID and identi?er

You can also retrieve a blob using the quilt ID and the blob's identi?er:

# Retrieve a blob with identifier `walrus.jpg` from the quilt.
curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-quilt-id/6XUOE-Q5-
nAXHRifN6n9nomVDtHZQbGuAkW3PjlBuKo/walrus.jpg" \

Both methods return the raw blob bytes in the response body. Metadata such as the blob
identi?er and tags are returned as HTTP headers:

X-Quilt-Patch-Identifier : The identi?er of the blob within the quilt

ETag : The patch ID or quilt ID for caching purposes
Additional custom headers from blob tags (if con?gured)

Using a public aggregator or publisher

For some use cases (e.g., a public website), or to just try out the HTTP API, a publicly accessible
aggregator and/or publisher is required. On Walrus Testnet, many entities run public
aggregators and publishers. On Mainnet, there are no public publishers without authentication,
as they consume both SUI and WAL.

Software development kits (SDKs) and other
tools

SDKs maintained by Mysten Labs

Mysten Labs has built and published a Walrus TypeScript SDK, which supports a wide variety of
operations. See also the related examples.

The Walrus core team is also actively working on a Rust SDK for Walrus, which will be made
available some time after the Mainnet launch.

For data security, use the TypeScript SDK for Seal. It provides threshold encryption and onchain
access control for decentralized data protection. Also, refer to Data security for details.

Community-maintained SDKs

Besides these o?cial SDKs, there also exist a few uno?cial third-party SDKs for interacting with

the HTTP API exposed by Walrus aggregators and publishers:

Walrus Go SDK (maintained by the Nami Cloud team)
Walrus PHP SDK (maintained by the Suicore team)
Walrus Python SDK (maintained by the Standard Crypto team)

Finally, there is Tusky, a complete data storage platform built on Walrus, including encryption,

HTTP APIs, sharing capabilities, and more. Tusky maintains its own TypeScript SDK.

Explorers

There is currently the Walruscan blob explorer built and maintained by the Staketab team,
which supports exploring blobs, blob events, operators, etc. It also supports staking operations.

See the Awesome Walrus repository for more visualization tools.

Developer guide

This guide introduces all the concepts needed to build applications that use Walrus as a storage
or availability layer. The overview provides more background and explains in more detail how
Walrus operates internally.

This developer guide describes the following:

Components of Walrus of interest to developers that wish to use it for storage or
availability.
Operations supported through client binaries, APIs, or Sui operations.
Cost components of storage, how they are measured, and considerations for managing

those.
The Sui structures Walrus uses to store metadata, and how they can be read from Sui
smart contracts, or through the Sui SDK.
Data security guidance for encryption and access control of data stored on Walrus.

65/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Components

From a developer perspective, some Walrus components are objects and smart contracts on
Sui, and some components are Walrus-speci?c binaries and services. As a rule, Sui is used to
manage blob and storage node metadata, while Walrus-speci?c services are used to store and
read blob contents, which can be very large.

Walrus de?nes a number of objects and smart contracts on Sui:

A shared system object records and manages the current committee of storage nodes.
Storage resources represent empty storage space that may be used to store blobs.
Blob resources represent blobs being registered and certi?ed as stored.

Changes to these objects emit Walrus-related events.

The Walrus system object ID can be found in the Walrus  client_config.yaml  ?le (see

Con?guration). You may use any Sui explorer to look at its content, as well as explore the
content of blob objects. There is more information about these in the quick reference to the
Walrus Sui structures.

Walrus is also composed of a number of Walrus-speci?c services and binaries:

A client (binary) can be executed locally and provides a Command Line Interface (CLI), a
JSON API and an HTTP API to perform Walrus operations.
Aggregator services allow reading blobs via HTTP requests.
Publisher services are used to store blobs to Walrus.

A set of storage nodes store encoded blobs. These nodes form the decentralized storage
infrastructure of Walrus.

Aggregators, publishers, and other services use the client APIs to interact with Walrus. End
users of services using Walrus interact with the store via custom services, aggregators, or
publishers that expose HTTP APIs to avoid the need to run locally a binary client.

66/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Operations

Blob encoding and blob ID

Walrus stores blobs across storage nodes in an encoded form, and refers to blobs by their blob
ID. The blob ID is deterministically derived from the content of a blob and the Walrus
con?guration. The blob ID of two ?les with the same content will be the same.

You can derive the blob ID of a ?le locally using the command:  walrus blob-id <file path> .

Store

Walrus may be used to store a blob, via the native client APIs or a publisher.

Public access

All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all. Therefore you must not
use Walrus to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional

measures to protect con?dentiality.

Under the hood a number of operations happen both on Sui as well as on storage nodes:

The client or publisher encodes the blob and derives a blob ID that identi?es the blob. This
is a  u256  often encoded as a URL-safe base64 string.

A transaction is executed on Sui to purchase some storage from the system object, and
then to register the blob ID occupying this storage. Client APIs return the Sui blob object ID.
The transactions use SUI to purchase storage and pay for gas.
Encoded slivers of the blob are distributed to all storage nodes. They each sign a receipt.
Signed receipts are aggregated and submitted to the Sui blob object to certify the blob.
Certifying a blob emits a Sui event with the blob ID and the period of availability.

A blob is considered available on Walrus once the corresponding Sui blob object has been
certi?ed in the ?nal step. The steps involved in a store operation can be executed by the binary
client, or a publisher that accepts and publishes blobs via HTTP.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

67/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Walrus currently allows the storage of blobs up to a maximum size that may be determined
through the  walrus info  CLI command. The maximum blob size is currently 13.3√°GiB. You
may store larger blobs by splitting them into smaller chunks.

Blobs are stored for a certain number of epochs, as speci?ed at the time they were stored.
Walrus storage nodes ensure that within these epochs a read succeeds. The current Mainnet
uses an epoch duration of 2 weeks.

Read

Walrus can also be used to read a blob after it is stored by providing its blob ID. A read is
executed by performing the following steps:

The system object on Sui is read to determine the Walrus storage node committee.
A number of storage nodes are queried for blob metadata and the slivers they store.
The blob is reconstructed from the recovered slivers and checked against the blob ID.

The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client, or the aggregator
service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are extremely resilient and will

succeed in recovering the blob in all cases even if up to one-third of storage nodes are
unavailable. In most cases, after synchronization is complete, blob can be read even if two-
thirds of storage nodes are down.

Certify Availability

Walrus can be used to certify the availability of a blob using Sui. Checking that this happened
may currently be done in 3 di?erent ways:

A Sui SDK read can be used to authenticate the certi?ed blob event emitted when the

blob ID was certi?ed on Sui. The client  walrus blob-status  command may be used to

identify the event ID that needs to be checked.
A Sui SDK read may be used to authenticate the Sui blob object corresponding to the blob
ID, and check it is certi?ed, before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.
A Sui smart contract can read the blob object on Sui (or a reference to it) to check it is

certi?ed, before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.

The underlying protocol of the Sui light client returns digitally signed evidence for emitted
events or objects, and can be used by o?-line or non-interactive applications as a proof of
availability for the blob ID for a certain number of epochs.

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

68/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

Once a blob is certi?ed, Walrus will ensure that su?cient slivers will always be available on
storage nodes to recover it within the speci?ed epochs.

Delete

Stored blobs can be optionally set as deletable by the user that creates them. This metadata is

stored in the Sui blob object, and whether a blob is deletable or not is included in certi?ed blob
events. A deletable blob may be deleted by the owner of the blob object, to reclaim and re-use
the storage resource associated with it.

If no other copies of the blob exist in Walrus, deleting a blob will eventually make it
unrecoverable using read commands. However, if other copies of the blob exist on Walrus, a

delete command will reclaim storage space for the user that invoked it, but will not make the
blob unavailable until all other copies have been deleted or expire.

Walrus

Storage costs

Storing blobs on Walrus Mainnet consumes WAL for the storage operation, and SUI for
executing transactions on Sui. This section provides a summary of the costs involved, and also
some advice on how to manage or minimize them for speci?c scenarios.

This document deals with costs of storage speci?cally. You can ?nd a wider discussion about
the WAL tokenonmics, and the role it plays in the Walrus delegated proof of stake system
elsewhere.

Understanding the 4 sources of cost

The four sources of cost associated with Walrus Storage are acquiring storage resources,
uploads, Sui transactions, and Sui objects on chain:

Storage resources. A storage resource is needed to store a blob, with an appropriate
capacity and epoch duration. Storage resources can be acquired from the Walrus system
contract while there is free space available on the system against some WAL. Other
options are also available, such as buying them from the subsidy contract, having it
transferred, or splitting a larger resource bought occasionally into smaller ones (see
discussion below).

Upload costs. Upon blob registration, some WAL is charged to cover the costs of data
upload. This ensures that deleting blobs and reusing the same storage resource for
storing a new blob is sustainable for the system.

Sui transactions. Storing a blob involves up to three on-chain actions on Sui. One to
acquire a storage resource, another (possibly combined with the ?rst) to register the blob

and associate it with a blob ID, and a ?nal one to certify the blob as available. These incur
some Sui gas costs in SUI to cover the costs of computation.

On chain objects. Finally, Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects on-chain. Creating
these objects sets aside some SUI into the Sui storage fund, and most of it is refunded
when the objects are deleted after they are not needed any more.

The size of the storage resource needed to store a blob, and the size taken into account to pay
for the upload costs, corresponds to the encoded size of a blob. The encoded size of a blob is
the size of the erasure coded blob, which is about 5x larger than the unencoded original blob
size, and the size of some metadata that is independent of the size of the blob. Since the ?xed
size per-blob metadata is quite large (about 64MB in the worse case), the cost of storing small

https://docs.wal.app/print.html

70/209

7/28/25, 9:22 PM

Walrus

blobs (< 10MB) is dominated by this, and the size of storing larger blobs is dominated by their
increasing size. See Reducing costs for small blobs for more information on cost optimization
strategies.

The Walrus CLI uses some strategies to lower costs but is not guaranteed to be optimal for all
use-cases. For high volume or other cost sensitive users there may be strategies that further
lower costs, which we discuss below.

Measuring costs

The most accurate way to measure the costs of a store for a certain size is to perform a store
for a blob of the same size, and observe the costs in SUI and WAL in a Sui explorer (or directly
through Sui RPC calls). Blob contents do not a?ect costs.

A  walrus store <FILENAME> --epochs 1  command will result in 2 transactions:

The ?rst transaction will perform a  reserve_space  (if no storage resource of appropriate

size exists) and  register_blob ; and will a?ect the balances of both SUI and WAL.

The second will perform a single call to  certify_blob  and will only change the SUI

balance.

You can observe the storage rebate on an explorer by burning the resulting blob objects using
the command  walrus burn-blobs --object-ids <BLOB_OBJECT_ID> . As discussed below,

burning the object on Sui does not delete the blob on Walrus.

As a rule of thumb, the SUI costs of  register_blob  and  certify_blob  are independent of

blob size or epoch lifetime. The WAL costs of  register_blob  are linear in the encoded size of

the blob (both erasure coding and metadata). Calls to  reserve_space  have SUI costs that grow
in the number of epochs, and WAL costs linear with both encoded size and the number of
epochs.

A few commands output information that can assist in cost estimations, without submitting

transactions:

The  walrus info  command displays the current costs for buying storage resources from

the system contract and also cost of uploads.

The  walrus store --dry-run ...  command outputs the encoded size that is used in

calculations of WAL costs. The  --dry-run  parameter ensures no transactions are

submitted on chain. Note that currently, the estimated WAL cost does not take subsidies
into account and as such is an overestimate while subsidies are available.

Managing and minimizing costs

There are multiple ways of acquiring storage resources, which impact their costs.

The primary means is by sending some WAL to the Walrus system contract to "buy" a storage
resource for some size in bytes and a de?ned lifetime in epochs. Currently, the Walrus

Foundation also operates a subsidy contract that allows acquiring storage resources at a lower
WAL cost as compared with the System contract. The Walrus CLI and the publisher use the
subsidy contract by default to lower costs if a subsidy object is included in the con?guration
?le.

Furthermore, before acquiring a storage resource, the CLI client will use any user-owned

storage resource of an appropriate length (in epochs and size in bytes). However, the current
implementation does not make any attempts yet to properly split or merge storage resources.

There are a few ways to minimize costs associated with the need for storage resources. First,
acquiring resources from either the system or subsidy contract involves at least one Sui
transaction interacting with a relatively complex shared object Sui smart contract. Therefore,
acquiring larger storage resources at once both in length and size minimizes the SUI gas costs.
Storage resources can then be split and merged to store smaller blobs or blobs for shorter
time periods. Packing multiple smart contract calls into a single Sui PTB to manage storage
resource acquisition, splitting and merging can also keep costs down.

Storage resources can be reclaimed and reused for the remainder of their validity period, by

deleting non-expired blobs that were created as deletable. Therefore, dapps that only need to
store data for less time than a multiple of full epochs (two weeks on Mainnet), can potentially
reduce costs by actively deleting blobs, and re-using the storage for other blobs.

Storage resources can be transferred and traded, and we foresee other markets and ways to
acquire them to exist in the future.

Registering blobs and certifying them costs SUI to cover gas costs, and WAL to cover upload
costs. Each blob needs to go through both of these and therefore not much may be done about
these costs. However, multiple blobs may be registered or certi?ed in a single Sui PTB both to
reduce latency and, possibly, costs when storing multiple blobs. The CLI client uses this
approach when uploading multiple blobs simultaneously. Within the same PTB storage

resource management actions can also be performed to acquire storage or split/merge storage
resources to further reduce latency and costs.

Each blob stored on Walrus also creates a Sui object representing the blob. While these objects
are not large and only contains metadata, storage on Sui is comparatively expensive and object
costs can add up. Once the blob validity period expires the blob object has no use and can be

burned. This will reclaim most of the storage costs associated with storage on Sui.

Walrus

The blob objects are used to manage blob lifecycle, such as extending blob lifetimes, deleting
them to reclaim storage resources, or adding attributes. In case none of these actions are
needed anymore, the blob object may be burned through the CLI or a smart contract call, to
save on Sui storage costs. This does not delete the blob on Walrus. Depending on the relative
costs of SUI and WAL it might be cheaper to burn a long lived blob object, and subsequently re-
registering and re-certifying them close to the end of its lifetime to extend it.

Reducing costs for small blobs

Walrus Quilt is a batch storage tool that reduces storage costs for small blobs. When multiple
blobs are stored together, the metadata costs are amortized across the batch. Quilt can also
signi?cantly reduce Sui computation and storage costs, as detailed in the Lower Cost section.

The future

The Walrus team has planned initiatives to reduce costs for all blob sizes by making metadata
smaller, as well as further improving the e?ciency of Quilt for small blob storage.

Sui Structures

This section is optional and enables advanced use cases, leveraging Sui smart contract
interactions with the Walrus smart contract.

You can interact with Walrus purely through the client CLI, and JSON or HTTP APIs provided,
without querying or executing transactions on Sui directly. However, Walrus uses Sui to

manage its metadata and smart contract developers can read information about the Walrus
system, as well as stored blobs, on Sui.

The Move code of the Walrus system contracts is available and you can ?nd an example smart
contract that implements a wrapped blob. The following sections provide further insights into

the contract and an overview of how you may use Walrus objects in your own Sui smart
contracts.

Blob and storage objects

Walrus blobs are represented as Sui objects of type  Blob . A blob is ?rst registered, indicating

that the storage nodes should expect slivers from a Blob ID to be stored. Then a blob is
certi?ed, indicating that a su?cient number of slivers have been stored to guarantee the blob's
availability. When a blob is certi?ed, its  certified_epoch  ?eld contains the epoch in which it

was certi?ed.

A  Blob  object is always associated with a  Storage  object, reserving enough space for a long

enough period for the blob's storage. A certi?ed blob is available for the period the underlying
storage resource guarantees storage.

Concretely,  Blob  and  Storage  objects have the following ?elds, which can be read through

the Sui SDKs:

/// Reservation for storage for a given period, which is inclusive start,

public struct Storage has key, store {
    id: UID,
    start_epoch: u32,
    end_epoch: u32,
    storage_size: u64,
}

/// The blob structure represents a blob that has been registered to with some
storage,
/// and then may eventually be certified as being available in the system.
public struct Blob has key, store {
    id: UID,
    registered_epoch: u32,
    blob_id: u256,
    size: u64,
    encoding_type: u8,
    // Stores the epoch first certified if any.
    certified_epoch: option::Option<u32>,
    storage: Storage,
    // Marks if this blob can be deleted.
    deletable: bool,
}

Public functions associated with these objects can be found in the respective
storage_resource  move module and  blob  move module. Storage resources can be split and

merged in time and data capacity, and can be transferred between users allowing complex

contracts to be created.

Events

Walrus uses custom Sui events extensively to notify storage nodes of updates concerning
stored Blobs and the state of the network. Applications may also use Sui RPC facilities to
observe Walrus related events.

When a blob is ?rst registered, a  BlobRegistered  event is emitted that informs storage nodes

that they should expect slivers associated with its Blob ID. Eventually when the blob is certi?ed,
a  BlobCertified  is emitted containing information about the blob ID and the epoch after

which the blob will be deleted. Before that epoch the blob is guaranteed to be available.

The  BlobCertified  event with  deletable  set to false and an  end_epoch  in the future

indicates that the blob will be available until this epoch. A light client proof that this event was
emitted for a blob ID constitutes a proof of availability for the data with this blob ID. When a
deletable blob is deleted, a  BlobDeleted  event is emitted.
