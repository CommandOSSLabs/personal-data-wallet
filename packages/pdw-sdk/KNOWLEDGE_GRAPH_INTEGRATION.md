# Knowledge Graph Integration with StorageService

## Overview

Successfully integrated comprehensive knowledge graph capabilities into the StorageService using the existing GraphService from the PDW SDK. This integration provides AI-powered entity and relationship extraction, graph traversal, and persistent storage combined with HNSW vector search.

## ✅ Completed Integration

### 1. **GraphService Integration**
- ✅ Added GraphService import and initialization to StorageService
- ✅ Replaced old graphManager with direct GraphService usage
- ✅ Integrated GraphService with existing embedding capabilities
- ✅ Proper TypeScript type integration with imported interfaces

### 2. **Knowledge Graph Storage**
- ✅ In-memory knowledge graph storage with user-specific caching
- ✅ Dirty tracking for efficient persistence
- ✅ Graph metadata tracking (version, timestamps, source memories)
- ✅ Walrus persistence framework (ready for blob ID tracking)

### 3. **Enhanced Upload Operations**
- ✅ `uploadWithFullIndexing()` - Combines HNSW indexing + knowledge graph extraction
- ✅ Automatic entity/relationship extraction from uploaded content
- ✅ Confidence-based filtering for quality assurance
- ✅ Graph caching and dirty tracking for persistence

### 4. **Knowledge Graph Operations**
- ✅ `extractKnowledgeGraph()` - Extract entities/relationships from text
- ✅ `searchKnowledgeGraph()` - Search by entity types, relationships, text
- ✅ `findRelatedEntities()` - Graph traversal with configurable hop limits
- ✅ `extractKnowledgeGraphBatch()` - Batch processing with rate limiting
- ✅ `getUserKnowledgeGraph()` - Get/create user-specific graphs

### 5. **Analytics and Statistics**
- ✅ `getGraphStatistics()` - Comprehensive graph metrics using GraphService
- ✅ `getKnowledgeGraphAnalytics()` - Entity types, relationships, connectivity
- ✅ Graph density, average connections, component analysis
- ✅ Extraction statistics and performance monitoring

### 6. **Background Persistence**
- ✅ `startGraphPersistence()` - Background auto-save with configurable intervals
- ✅ `saveKnowledgeGraphToWalrus()` - Serialize and save to Walrus
- ✅ `loadKnowledgeGraphFromWalrus()` - Deserialize and load from Walrus
- ✅ Dirty tracking to avoid unnecessary saves

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
```typescript
StorageService
├── GraphService (AI-powered extraction)
├── KnowledgeGraph storage (in-memory + Walrus)
├── HNSW vector search (existing)
├── Embedding service (existing) 
└── Background persistence
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Text Content → GraphService.extractEntitiesAndRelationships()
2. Extracted Graph → GraphService.addToGraph()  
3. Updated Graph → In-memory cache + dirty tracking
4. Background Process → saveKnowledgeGraphToWalrus()
5. Search Operations → GraphService.queryGraph() + findRelatedEntities()
```

### Integration Points
- **Upload Operations**: `uploadWithFullIndexing()` combines HNSW + graph extraction
- **Search Operations**: Both vector search and graph traversal available
- **Analytics**: Unified statistics from HNSW index + knowledge graph
- **Persistence**: Coordinated storage of vectors + graphs to Walrus

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Knowledge Graph Extraction
```typescript
const extractionResult = await storageService.extractKnowledgeGraph(
  content,
  memoryId,
  { confidenceThreshold: 0.7 }
);
```

### Upload with Full Indexing
```typescript
const result = await storageService.uploadWithFullIndexing(
  content,
  metadata,
  userAddress,
  { signer, epochs: 3 }
);
// Returns: { blobId, vectorId, graphExtracted: boolean }
```

### Knowledge Graph Search
```typescript
const results = await storageService.searchKnowledgeGraph(userAddress, {
  entityTypes: ['person', 'organization'],
  searchText: 'artificial intelligence',
  limit: 10
});
```

### Graph Traversal
```typescript
const related = await storageService.findRelatedEntities(
  userAddress,
  seedEntityIds,
  { maxHops: 2 }
);
```

### Batch Processing
```typescript
const batchResults = await storageService.extractKnowledgeGraphBatch(
  memories,
  userAddress,
  { batchSize: 5, delayMs: 1000 }
);
```
