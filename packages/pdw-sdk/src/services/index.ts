// - HnswIndexService -> consolidated into VectorService âœ…

/**
 * Service Consolidation Status:
 * 
 * âœ… COMPLETED:
 * - BatchService: Unified batch processing + caching (was BatchingService + BatchManager)
 * - VectorService: Unified vector operations + indexing (was HnswIndexService + VectorManager)
 * 
 * ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS:
 * - StorageService: Production-ready main storage service (already exists, needs consolidation with duplicates)
 * 
 * ðŸ“‹ PENDING:
 * - Consolidate 6 duplicate storage services into single StorageService
 * - Move infrastructure clients to infrastructure/ directory
 * - Remove old fragmented directories
 * - Update all import paths across SDK
 * 
 * CLEAN ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:
 * - Services contain business logic only
 * - Infrastructure dependencies injected via constructor
 * - Consistent Service suffix naming
 * - No duplicate implementations
 * - Clear separation of concerns
