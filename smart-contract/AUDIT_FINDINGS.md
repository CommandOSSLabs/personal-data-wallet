# Sui Move Contract Audit - SEAL Access Control

## Audit Summary

This audit was conducted following Sui Move best practices and official Move Book guidelines. The contract has been updated to address initialization, event tracking, and access management issues.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Initialization and Registry Sharing** (HIGH)

**Issue**: The `init` function created and shared an `AccessRegistry` object without providing a way to reference or track its ID.

**Impact**: No way for users or other modules to reference the created registry unless they have its address.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added `RegistryCreated` event emission with registry ID and creator address
- ✅ Improved init function documentation and structure
- ✅ Added proper event tracking for registry creation

### 2. ❌ **Access Level Validation** (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Access level validation was case-sensitive with hardcoded strings, making integration error-prone.

**Impact**: Integration difficulty and potential runtime errors from typos.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added constants `ACCESS_LEVEL_READ` and `ACCESS_LEVEL_WRITE` for standardized validation
- ✅ Updated validation logic to use constants instead of inline strings
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation for expected values

### 3. ❌ **Event Tracking** (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: No events were emitted for content registration, access changes, or permission management.

**Impact**: Difficult to index and track access control changes off-chain.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added `ContentRegistered` event for content ownership tracking
- ✅ Added `AccessChanged` event for permission grants/revocations
- ✅ Event emission in all critical functions

### 4. ❌ **Error Handling** (LOW-MEDIUM)

**Issue**: Limited error constants and no validation for expired permissions or invalid timestamps.

**Impact**: Poor error messages and potential security issues with timestamp validation.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive error constants: `EContentNotFound`, `EPermissionExpired`, `EInvalidTimestamp`
- ✅ Added timestamp validation in `grant_access` function
- ✅ Better error handling throughout the contract

### 5. ❌ **Permission Maintenance** (LOW)

**Issue**: No mechanism to clean up expired permissions, leading to storage bloat.

**Impact**: Unnecessary storage usage and gas costs over time.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added `cleanup_expired_permission` function for maintenance
- ✅ Public entry function that anyone can call to clean up expired permissions
- ✅ Event emission for cleanup tracking

## Security Improvements

### Access Control
- ✅ Proper owner verification before granting/revoking access
- ✅ Timestamp validation to prevent past-dated permissions
- ✅ Content registration validation to prevent duplicate registration

### SEAL Integration
- ✅ The critical `seal_approve` function remains unchanged to maintain SEAL SDK compatibility
- ✅ Proper boolean return values for access approval decisions
- ✅ Owner access always granted regardless of explicit permissions

### Event Emission
- ✅ All state changes now emit appropriate events for indexing
- ✅ Events contain all necessary information for off-chain tracking
- ✅ Events follow Sui Move conventions with `copy` and `drop` abilities

## Integration Guidelines

### For Frontend Developers

**Access Levels**: Use exactly these strings:
- `"read"` - for read-only access
- `"write"` - for read-write access (includes read access)

**Event Listening**: Listen for these events:
- `RegistryCreated` - Track when registry is deployed
- `ContentRegistered` - Track new content ownership
- `AccessChanged` - Track all permission changes

### For Backend Integration

**Transaction Patterns**:
```typescript
// Register content
tx.moveCall({
  target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::seal_access_control::register_content`,
  arguments: [
    tx.object(REGISTRY_ID),
    tx.pure.string(content_id),
    tx.object(CLOCK_ID),
  ],
});

// Grant access
tx.moveCall({
  target: `${PACKAGE_ID}::seal_access_control::grant_access`,
  arguments: [
    tx.object(REGISTRY_ID),
    tx.pure.address(recipient_address),
    tx.pure.string(content_id),
    tx.pure.string("read"), // or "write"
    tx.pure.u64(expires_timestamp),
    tx.object(CLOCK_ID),
  ],
});
```

## Contract Compliance

✅ **Move Book Standards**: All patterns follow official Sui Move guidelines
✅ **Initialization**: Proper `init` function with event emission
✅ **Event Design**: Events have `copy` and `drop` abilities as required
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error constants and validation
✅ **Documentation**: Inline documentation for all public functions
✅ **Security**: Proper access control and validation throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with actual SEAL SDK integration
3. **Event Tests**: Verify all events are emitted correctly
4. **Gas Tests**: Test gas consumption for cleanup operations
5. **Security Tests**: Test access control bypass attempts

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Update `SUI_PACKAGE_ID` in environment variables after deployment
- [ ] Set up event indexing for `RegistryCreated`, `ContentRegistered`, and `AccessChanged` events
- [ ] Configure monitoring for expired permission cleanup
- [ ] Update frontend integration to use standardized access level strings
- [ ] Test SEAL SDK integration with updated contract
