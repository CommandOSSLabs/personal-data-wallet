## ⚠️ Risk Management & Blockers

### Current Active Risks

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**
1. **Team Hiring Delays**
   - **Risk**: Blockchain/AI engineer recruitment taking longer than expected
   - **Impact**: 2-4 week delay on Phases 2-3
   - **Mitigation**: Start recruitment immediately, consider contractors

2. **SEAL SDK Integration Complexity**  
   - **Risk**: IBE implementation more complex than anticipated
   - **Impact**: 1-2 week delay on encryption features
   - **Mitigation**: Early POC in Week 4, fallback to AES encryption

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**  
3. **Walrus Network Stability**
   - **Risk**: Testnet instability affecting development
   - **Mitigation**: Local storage fallback for development

4. **Gemini API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk**: Development velocity limited by API quotas
   - **Mitigation**: Request higher limits, implement local caching

### Weekly Risk Review
Every Friday we'll assess:
- Team availability and capacity
- Technical blockers and solutions  
- Timeline adjustments needed
- Budget variance analysis
